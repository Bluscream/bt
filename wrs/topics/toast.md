# Toast

Toast was added in 5.1.1 to visually notify which browser and profile was used to open a link. This makes you aware that %product% is working, and which browser/profile was chosen, especially when using automatic rules.

Toasting is enabled by default, but can be disabled in the main window's options. You can also configure several options related to toast.
