## Contributing

I value your interest in this open-source project. While **I don't accept pull requests** (there is no way to turn them off in GitHub), your support through coffee donations directly contributes to the project's development and sustainability, allowing me to invest more resources into refining, addressing issues, and implementing new features. Your involvement, in any form, is greatly appreciated. Thank you for being a part of our journey!
