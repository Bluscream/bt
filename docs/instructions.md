There are [installation instructions](https://www.aloneguid.uk/projects/bt/#installing) available if you need them. I also have optional integration extensions for [Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/browser-tamer/oggcljknmiiomjekepdoindjcpnpglnd), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/browser-tamer/gofjagaghddmjloaecpnldjmjlplicin) and Firefox.

I hope you enjoy this release. Feel free to raise issues or start discussions. And if you really like this project, please
