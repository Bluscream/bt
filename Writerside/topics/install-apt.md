# Package Managers

I personally don't have enough time to support deployments to package managers, but some were done by the community. Note that version in package managers is often outdated, and you should install from GitHub if you can. 

## WinGet

```bash
winget install IvanG.BrowserTamer
```

## Scoop

```bash
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install extras/bt
```

## Chocolatey
